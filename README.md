# ACME Auto Parts & Plumbing Corporation, Inc.

Welcome to ACME Auto Parts & Plumbing, a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary of ACME Bait &
Tackle Corporation where quality is our #1 dream! This is the ACME operations
repository of development cooking and pipe laying, continuously.

## Overview

This is a artistic rendering of a proof-of-concept Jenkins pipeline complete
with a Chef Server, [ELKstack](elksack) ([Elasticsearch](elasticsearch),
[Logstash](logstash), and [Kibana](kinana)), [Consul](consul) and [Seagull]
(seagull) running as Docker containers using Google Kubernetes.

The docker containers used for this pipeline are somewhat unorthodox by design,
because docker is so light-weight it provides and excellent platform for running
a large number of simultaneous machines. As such they do not follow the normal
Docker practice of lightweight containers running a single process. Instead
these are FatBoy™ containers complete with a process supervisor, SSH, [Consul]
(consul), cron, log rotation and NTP.

## Quick Start Guide

Also know as 'runs with scissors' Assuming your machine meets the basic
requirements, has docker-machine installed running boot2docker version >= 1.6.2
and ChefDK;

If you haven't yet built the Docker containers you will need to do step 1 first,
if you already have the containers build skip ahead to step 3.

1. Clone the docker-containers git repo and `bundle install` required gems:
    
		$ git clone https://github.com/riddopic/docker-containers
	    $ cd docker-containers
	    $ bundle install
	    
2. Make all target containers:

	   	$ make all

3. Clone the thrashmaster git repo and `bundle install` required gems:

	    $ git clone https://github.com/riddopic/thrashmaster
	    $ cd thrashmaster
	    $ bundle install

4. Start the ACME Gas 'n' Go & Fine Wines, Inc. Pipeline in a Box where where
   quality is our #1 dream!:

	    $ rake start

This can take some time depending on the speed of your machine and your network
connection. Once the task has completed it will have start several containers
and used Chef to bootstrap your Jenkins master and a slave node.

Container | ACME Pipeline Stack Description
------------ | -------------
`consul` | This container is responsible for DNS and service discover. You can connect to the consul UI via [http://consul.acme.dev:8500][]. By using the DNS server built into the Consul server you are able to to DNS resolution.
`chef` | This is the Chef 12 Server for the Pipeline stack.
`seagull` | Provides a friendly Web UI to monitor docker and get a visual representation of your running infrastructure.
`ElasticSearch` | Part of the ELKStack.
`LogStash` | Part of the ELKStack.
`Kibana` | Part of the ELKStack: [http://kibana.acme.com][]
`Jenkins` | Jenkins master: [http://jenkins.acme.com][]
`Slave` | Slave Jenkins worker

## Requirements

Before trying to build and use the containers make sure you have a supported
system. You will need docker and docker-machine installed, with a boot2docker
ISO of 1.6.2 or higher, and Vagrant, and a virtualization platform such as
VirtualBox or VMware Fusion. To get running you will need:

 - Install Xcode Command line tools
 - Configure Git
 - Install Homebrew and Homebrew Cask
 - GNU Tools
 - Vagrant
 - VirtualBox
 - VMware Fusion
 - Docker Machine
 - ChefDK (Chef Developers Kit) and miscellaneous tools.

Thankfully this has become a relatively painless process so let’s get started!
We will be doing most of our work in a terminal windows, the quickest way to
open one is to use Spotlight, press Command-Spacebar key-combination and type in
"terminal" and slap that Enter key like you mean it!

### Is Xcode Already Installed?

You don’t need the full Xcode package to get the Xcode Command Line Tools.
However, you may have previously installed the full Xcode package. To check if
the full Xcode package is already installed:

    $ xcode-select -p

If you see:

    /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer

the full Xcode package is already installed.

You will need to update Xcode to the newest version (Xcode 6 or newer). Go to
the App Store application and check “Updates.” After updating Xcode, be sure to
launch the Xcode application and accept the Apple license terms.

If you see a file location that contains spaces in the path:

    /Applications/Apple Dev Tools/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer

you must delete Xcode. ChefDK and most command line tools will not work with
spaces in the path. You can either install only the Xcode Command Line Tools
(instructions below) or reinstalled the full Xcode package.

### Install Xcode Command Line Tools

Mac OS X Yosemite will alert you when you enter a command in the terminal that
requires Xcode Command Line Tools. For example, you can enter gcc, git, or make.

Try it. Enter:

    $ gcc

You’ll see an alert box:

![installing-mavericks-popup.png](installing-mavericks-popup.png)

Alternatively, you can use a command to install Xcode Command Line Tools. It
will produce a similar alert box. Note the double hyphen:

    $ xcode-select --install

Click “Install” to download and install Xcode Command Line Tools.

The instructions in the alert box are confusing. You don’t need to “Get Xcode”
from the App Store. Just click “Install” for the Xcode Command Line Tools.

![installing-mavericks-download.png](installing-mavericks-download.png)

Verify that you’ve successfully installed Xcode Command Line Tools:

    $ xcode-select -p
    /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools

Just to be certain, verify that gcc is installed:

    $ gcc --version
    Configured with: --prefix=/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr --with-gxx-include-dir=/usr/include/c++/4.2.1
    Apple LLVM version 6.0 (clang-600.0.54) (based on LLVM 3.5svn)
    Target: x86_64-apple-darwin14.0.0
    Thread model: posix

### Configure Git

Git is automatically installed as part of the Xcode Command Line Tools. Or, if
you updated from a previous version of Mac OS X, you may have installed Git
previously.

Check that Git is installed:

    $ git version
    git version 1.9.3 (Apple Git-50)

Configure Git if you haven’t used it before. First, list the current settings
with the git config -l --global command. Then set user.name and user.email if
necessary:

    $ git config -l --global
    fatal: unable to read config file '/Users/.../.gitconfig': No such file or directory

    $ git config --global user.name "Your Real Name"
    $ git config --global user.email me@example.com
    $ git config --global color.ui true
    $ git config -l --global
    user.name=Your Real Name
    user.email=me@example.com

If you don’t have an SSH key generated yet to use with Git you can create one:

    $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "me@example.com"

The next step is to take the newly generated SSH key and add it to your Github
and/or Stash account. You want to copy and paste the output of the following
command and paste it here for Github, Stash will have a similar page to enter
your key but I will leave it up to you to find that link.

    $ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

Once you've done this, you can check and see if it worked:

    $ ssh -T git@github.com

You should get a message like this:

    Hi riddopic! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.

Now you’ll be ready to use Git when you need it.

### Install Homebrew

Homebrew is a package manager for OS X. If you ever meet the guy who wrote
Homebrew buy him a beer.

    $ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

### Install Homebrew Cask

Next we need to install Homebrew Cask, an add-on that allows you to install OSX
applications from the command line:

    $ brew install caskroom/cask/brew-cask

### Install GNU Utilities

Now let’s have some fun and start installing some software! First make sure you
have the latest Homebrew:

    $ brew update

If you need to upgrade any already-installed formulae:

    $ brew upgrade

Next I like to install GNU core utilities (those that come with OS X are
outdated), if you do don’t forget to add
$(brew --prefix coreutils)/libexec/gnubin` to `$PATH`.

    $ brew install coreutils

Install some other useful utilities like `sponge`

    $ brew install moreutils

Install GNU `find`, `locate`, `updatedb`, and `xargs`, `g`-prefixed

    $ brew install findutils

Install GNU `sed`, overwriting the built-in `sed`

    $ brew install gnu-sed --default-names

Install Figlet:

    $ brew install figlet

Now, let’s do some quick housekeeping:

    $ brew cleanup

### Install Vagrant

GUI type applications are installed with Cask:

    $ brew cask install vagrant

### Install VirtualBox

    $ brew cask install virtualbox

#### Install VMware Fusion

You will need a license to use this.

    $ brew cask install vmware-fusion

### Install Docker Machine

    $ brew install docker docker-machine

#### Also install figlet:

    $ brew install figlet

#### Install ChefDK

    $ brew cask install chefdk

I prefer to use iTerm instead of the built-in Terminal application:

    $ brew cask install iterm2

Finally, you are going to need a good editor, vi, emacs, Atom, Textmate, are all
super editors, pick one if you don’t already have one you like:

GitHubs Atom editor:

    $ brew cask install atom

Sublime Text:

    $ brew cask install sublime-text

Textmate:

    $ brew cask install textmate

#### Starting a Docker Machine

We are going to launch our machine with 4GB of RAM and a 40GB volume using
version 1.6.2 of boot2docker:

##### VMware Workstation example:

    $ docker-machine create -d vmwarefusion \
      --vmwarefusion-memory-size 4096 \
      --virtualbox-disk-size 40000 \
      --vmwarefusion-boot2docker-url https://github.com/boot2docker/boot2docker/releases/download/v1.6.2/boot2docker.iso \
      dev -D

    INFO[0000] Downloading boot2docker.iso from https://github.com/boot2docker/boot2docker/releases/download/v1.6.2/boot2docker.iso...
    INFO[0014] Creating SSH key...
    INFO[0014] Creating VM...
    INFO[0014] Starting dev...
    INFO[0016] Waiting for VM to come online...
    INFO[0057] "dev" has been created and is now the active machine.
    INFO[0057] To point your Docker client at it, run this in your shell: docker-machine env dev | source

This will create a docker-machine named `dev` with the `vmwarefusion` complete
with 4GB of RAM and 40GB volume and have specified a URL for where to obtain the
boot2docker.ISO

##### VirtualBox example:

The default driver is Virtualbox and works virtually like the VMware driver
except where it doesn't.

    $ docker-machine create -d virtualbox \
    --virtualbox-memory 4096 \
    --virtualbox-disk-size 40960 \
    --virtualbox-boot2docker-url https://github.com/boot2docker/boot2docker/releases/download/v1.6.2/boot2docker.iso \
    dev

Once you docker-machine is up modify your shell environment to point to this
docker-machine instance;

To enable for just the current shell session, in sh, bash, and zsh:

    $ eval "$(docker-machine env dev)"

In fish:

    $ eval (chef shell-init fish)

To permanently enable (**recommended**):

In sh, bash, and zsh:

    $ echo 'eval "$(chef shell-init SHELL_NAME)"' >> ~/.YOUR_SHELL_RC_FILE

In fish:

    $ echo 'eval (chef shell-init SHELL_NAME)' >> ~/.config/fish/config.fish

Now check that your dockers are in order, first make sure your shell environment
settings are correctly setup by running:

    $ docker-machine ls
  NAME  ACTIVE  DRIVER        STATE    URL                       SWARM
  dev   *       vmwarefusion  Running  tcp://192.168.3.133:2376

Now let’s make sure you can connect to the machine via SSH:

    $ docker-machine ssh dev

                            ##        .
                      ## ## ##       ==
                   ## ## ## ##      ===
               /""""""""""""""""\___/ ===
          ~~~ {~~ ~~~~ ~~~ ~~~~ ~~ ~ /  ===- ~~~
               \______ o          __/
                 \    \        __/
                  \____\______/
     _                 _   ____     _            _

    Boot2Docker version 1.5.0, build vmw-1.5.0 : 67fcb7d - Wed Feb 18 10:00:58 UTC 2015
    Docker version 1.5.0, build a8a31ef
    docker@dev:~$

Finally, let’s try and launch a container:

    $ docker run -t -i centos:centos6 /bin/bash
    [root@fec71bd20e3c /]#

If all goes well you should find yourself in the shell of your newly created
CentOS container. Just type exit to go back to your normal shell and the machine
will then terminate. We can verify it has been shutdown with the docker command:

    $ docker ps -a
    CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                CREATED             STATUS                        PORTS               NAMES
    fec71bd20e3c        centos:centos6      "/bin/bash"            11 minutes ago      Exited (0) 11 minutes ago                         trusting_nobel

#### Configure Shell Environment for ChefDK Ruby

The ChefDK comes with it's own self-contained Ruby environment that plays well
with the rest of the Chef toolchain such as Berkshelf, Test Kitchen, ChefSpec
and Chef Provisioning. Activating the ChefDK Ruby environment in your shell is
done similarly to how it's done for docker-machine:

To enable for just the current shell session, in sh, bash, and zsh:

    $ eval "$(chef shell-init bash)"

In fish:

    $ eval (chef shell-init fish)

To permanently enable (**recommended**):

In sh, bash, and zsh:

    $ echo 'eval "$(chef shell-init SHELL_NAME)"' >> ~/.YOUR_SHELL_RC_FILE

In fish:

    $ echo 'eval (chef shell-init fish)' >> ~/.config/fish/config.fish

This will ensure SHELL PATH and ENVIRONMENT variables are configured correctly
for use with the ChefDK.

    $ which ruby
    /opt/chefdk/embedded/bin/ruby

Next we are going to bring up a virtual interface forAlias the loopback
interface. The reason for the loopback interface is to allow us to wildcard
*.dev record to go to a default address, for this we use the lo0 alias.

    $ sudo ifconfig lo0 alias 10.254.254.254

This then allows you to access your machine as with any *.dev domain.

    $ sudo route -n add 172.17.0.0/16 $(docker-machine ip)

In you `~/.ssh/config` ensure you have the following four lines:

Disable strict host key checking for SSH and connect as the kitchen user to our
docker instances:

    Host *.dev
      User kitchen
      StrictHostKeyChecking no
      UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null

Create the /etc/resolver directory and create the dev zone file:

    $ mkdir /etc/resolver
    $ echo "nameserver ${CONSUL_IP}" >> /etc/resolver/dev

What will now happen is any DNS lookups for the .dev top level domain will be
sent to the address listed in the /etc/resolver/dev file. The .dev domain had
for years been a private network which ICANN keep safe from the corporate
raiders. However recent changes in leadership at ICANN, bribes, corporate
raiding, user backlash and some the occasion blogger postings have lead to
the .dev domain fate being that of an unknown elephant waiting at the bus stop
for exact change.

### Chef 12 Server

Based off the Ubuntu 'FatBoy' 14.04 image, this image runs a Chef 12 Server, and
is specifically not configured with any redundancy nor is any of the data backed
up. This is purposefully done to ensure that it is regularly recycled and that
anything used to build the infrastructure is captured and automated.

#### Environment Variables

 - `PUBLIC_URL` - should be configured to a full public URL of the
   endpoint (e.g. `https://chef.mudbox.dev`)
 - `OC_ID_ADMINISTRATORS` - if set, it should be a comma-separated list of
   users that will be allowed to add oc_id applications (the Supermarket
   for example).

#### Ports

 - Ports 80 (HTTP) and  443 (HTTPS) are exposed.

#### Usage

To start the container `chef` with the hostname set to `chef.mudbox.dev`, using
the riddopic/chef-server base container:

    $ docker run -d --name chef -h chef.mudbox.dev \
    -e 'PUBLIC_URL=https://chef.mudbox.dev OC_ID_ADMINISTRATORS=jenkins' \
      riddopic/chef-server

#### Prerequisites and first start

The `kernel.shmmax` and `kernel.shmall` sysctl values should be set to
a high value on the docker-machine host.

To set the `kernel.shmmax` and `kernel.shmall` sysctl values run the following
on your docker hosts:

    $ docker-machine ssh dev -- sudo sysctl -w kernel.shmmax=17179869184
    $ docker-machine ssh dev -- sudo sysctl -w kernel.shmall=4194304

To make the change permanent add the values to `/etc/sysctl.con`:

    $ docker-machine ssh dev -- sudo sh -c 'kernel.shmmax=17179869184" \
    >> sysctl.conf'
    $ docker-machine ssh dev -- sudo sh \
    -c 'kernel.shmall=4194304" >> sysctl.conf'

First start will automatically run `chef-server-ctl reconfigure`. Subsequent
starts will not run `reconfigure`, unless file `/var/opt/opscode/bootstrapped`
has been deleted. You can run `reconfigure` (e.g. after editing
`etc/chef-server.rb`) using `docker-enter`.

#### Maintenance commands

Use `docker exec` to run commands on your Chef server:

    $ docker exec $CONTAINER_ID chef-server-ctl status
    $ docker exec $CONTAINER_ID chef-server-ctl user-create …
    $ docker exec $CONTAINER_ID chef-server-ctl org-create …
    $ docker exec $CONTAINER_ID chef-server-ctl …

#### Building

    $ cd docker-containers/chef-server && make build

      Building chef-server container from Dockerfile:
        Repository:   [acme]
        Name:       [chef-server]
        Version:    [12.3]

      docker build -t riddopic/chef-server:12.3 .

## System configuration

Alias the loopback interface, this allows for your docker machines to access your OS X machine and provides a wildcard DNS lookup by including `address=/dev/10.254.254.254` in our `dnsmasq.conf` file.

    $ sudo ifconfig lo0 alias 10.254.254.254

Create a route to the docker network you can access machines directly:

    $ sudo route -n add 172.17.0.0/16 $(docker-machine ip)

Configure SSH to be more tolerate of changing machines by disable strict host key checking and also connect as the kitchen user to the docker containers in the acme.dev domain by editing your `~/.ssh/config` file and ensure you have the following four lines:

	Host *.acme.dev
      User kitchen
